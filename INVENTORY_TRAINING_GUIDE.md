4. **Centralized Management**: All inventory changes sync across all systems

### Checking Current Stock

1. **In POS System**: Stock levels visible on each product card
2. **In GHL Dashboard**:

### Updating Stock Levels

#### Method 1: Through GHL Dashboard
1. Log into GHL account
2. Navigate to Products section
3. Select the product to update

2. **Smart Upgrade**: Converts walk-in profile to membership
3. **Data Preservation**: Keeps all existing customer information
4. **Tag Updates**: Adds membership tags and removes walk-in tags
5. **Seamless Process**: Customer doesn't experience any errors

#### Backend Endpoints
- `POST /upgrade-walkin-to-membership`: Handles the upgrade process
- `GET /check-contact/:phone`: Checks if contact exists

### Staff Training
**When customers want to upgrade from walk-in to membership:**
1. ‚úÖ Proceed normally with membership signup
2. ‚úÖ System will automatically handle phone number conflicts
3. ‚úÖ Customer profile gets upgraded, not duplicated
4. ‚úÖ All previous visit history is preserved
